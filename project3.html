    <h2>Project #3: Instructions</h2>

    <p>Project #3: Instructions required me to write a set of instructions for some software, allowing for easy use / installation of said software. It sought to help me learn how to explain a complicated task using smaller tasks and clear language.</p>

    <p>I approached the assignment eager to get started, as I had free reign to choose which software so long as it was appropriate. I decided to write the instructions on my own work-in-progress software, AdamLibSDL3. I had needed to write instructions on installation and use anyways, and decided the project would be a great way to do this with feedback.</p>

    <p>The original document was serviceable, and did accurately explain how to install and use the program, however I had several design and language flaws. There were design choices that made it confusing to the reader what steps they followed another, and images were seperated from their corresponding instruction. I've since revised this, and fixed some language that used the wrong tone and was overly wordy.</p>

    <p>The revised instruction set is shown below.</p>
