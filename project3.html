    <h2>Project #3: Instructions</h2>

    <p>Project #3 required me to create a detailed and user-friendly set of instructions for a piece of software. The purpose of the assignment was to help me practice breaking down a complex technical task into smaller, digestible steps while maintaining clarity, consistency, and accessibility in my writing. By learning to communicate technical processes effectively, I was able to better understand how instructional design plays a vital role in helping users interact with unfamiliar tools or applications.</p>

    <p>I approached the assignment with genuine enthusiasm, largely because I was given the freedom to choose any software as long as it was suitable for an instructional guide. This flexibility allowed me to align the project with my own interests and ongoing work. Ultimately, I chose to create the instruction set for my own work-in-progress library, AdamLibSDL3. Since I needed to develop documentation for its installation and usage anyway, the assignment provided the perfect opportunity to do so in a structured environment where I could also receive valuable feedback. Working on documentation for a tool I personally developed made the task more engaging and gave me a clearer sense of purpose.</p>

    <p>Although the original document successfully conveyed the essential steps for installing and using the software, it had several issues related to design, organization, and tone. Some sections lacked a logical flow, making it difficult for readers to understand which steps followed one another. Additionally, images were sometimes placed far from the instructions they were meant to illustrate, which disrupted the reading experience and could confuse users following along. The writing itself also suffered from moments of unnecessary wordiness and an inconsistent tone that occasionally felt unprofessional or overly casual.</p>

    <p>After reviewing these weaknesses, I revised the instruction set to improve both clarity and usability. I repositioned images so they directly correspond with their relevant instructions, and refined the language to achieve a more concise and consistent tone. The improved version of the instruction set is shown below.</p>
