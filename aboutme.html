      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Adam Lugo, a third year Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, attending for a Bachelor's of Science. My favorite courses so far have been System's Software and Computer Architecture and Design.</p>
      <p>I really enjoy low-level programming. My first love was C and my current is C++. In fact I love it so much I'm currently developing a game engine/library designed to be used directly with C++ as its main 'scripting' and logic language. It's modeled after Godot, which is the only engine I've really enjoyed using.</p>
      <p>Outside of school I spend some of my time developing C++ or reading up on it, as well as hitting the gym and going for unnecessarily long walks.</p>
      <p>For work I'm an independent tutor. I also tutor as a hobby for anyone around me who needs it, as I enjoy it quite a bit. Previously I've spent my time in and out of fast food, with a notable exception of being a parade attendant during the Universal Studios 2024 Christmas Macy's Parade.</p>
