    <h2>Project #1: Job Materials</h2>

    <p>Project #1: Job Materials required me to creating resume and cover letter documents, for the purpose of practice. It sought to help me learn how to describe my experiences and qualifications clearly to prospective employers, while also learning how to create clean and error-free documents.</p>

    <p>I originally approached the assignment somewhat naively, as I had no experience making a resume or cover letter. The cover letter was of decent quality, but the resume was made quite poorly and with major formatting errors.</p>

    <p>The assignment helped me learn the basics and standards of creating a technical document, as well as how much the formatting and style of a document communicates to the reader in addition to the text.</p>

    <p>I've learned from the feedback i've recieved, and my coursework, and since have entirely overhauled the resume. The cover letter remains untouched because the position at the company has since been filled. Shown below is the revamped resume.</p>
