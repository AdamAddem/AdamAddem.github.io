    <h2>Project #2: UN SDG Research</h2>

    <p>Project #2: UN SDG Research required me and a small group to work together and conduct research to support the SDG Goal #4: Quality Education. We conducted this research through surveys and secondary sources, and then created an infographic and write up based upon our work.</p>

    <p>We approached the assignment with interest, as we were allowed to choose our own topic provided it fit the goal. We chose to study the ethical and practical use of AI tools in classrooms, specifically in Computer Science subjects.</p>

    <p>The document we created was of quality, although we did not failed at some points. The language used in the infographic did not convey enough meaning to an un-technical reader, and we failed to explicitly connect some of the data to the main topic. We've learned that being more explicit in our language serves to help get our point accross much more effectively.</p>

    <p>The project below is revised to have more explicit language, as well as added citations, modified graphs, and a cleaned up look.</p>
