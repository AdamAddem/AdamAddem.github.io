    <h2>Project #2: UN SDG Research</h2>

    <p>Project #2: UN SDG Research required my group and me to collaborate closely in order to investigate an issue connected to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #4: Quality Education. The assignment challenged us to identify a topic that supported this goal, gather credible data through both primary and secondary research, and present our findings in the form of an infographic accompanied by a written explanation. To meet these expectations, we designed and distributed surveys, reviewed relevant academic and industry sources, and synthesized the information into a coherent analysis. Our final deliverables aimed to demonstrate not only our understanding of the topic, but also our ability to communicate our findings clearly and effectively.</p>

    <p>We approached the project with genuine interest because we were given the freedom to select a subject that aligned with the SDG while also appealing to our academic focus. After considering several possibilities, we chose to investigate the ethical and practical use of artificial intelligence tools in educational environments, with particular emphasis on their emerging role in Computer Science classrooms. This topic felt especially relevant, as the rapid adoption of AI technologies has created both exciting opportunities and significant challenges for educators and students alike. Our goal was to explore how these tools can support learning while also identifying the risks, limitations, and ethical considerations that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of educational outcomes.</p>

    <p>Although the document and infographic we produced demonstrated effort and thoughtful analysis, we recognized several weaknesses upon review. Some of the language we used in the infographic was too technical for a general audience, which reduced the clarity and accessibility of our message. Additionally, a few of our data points were not explicitly connected to our central argument, making the overall narrative less cohesive than we intended. Through this experience, we learned the importance of using precise, audience-appropriate language and ensuring that every element of a project directly supports its main purpose.</p>

    <p>The revised version of the project below reflects these lessons. It features clearer and more explicit explanations, improved visual organization, updated citations, refined graphs, and a more polished overall presentation.</p>
